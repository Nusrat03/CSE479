                            <p>The Computer and Information Science Program at East West University puts forth great emphasis on technical and professional 
                                education that merges the academic course work with relevant "hands-on" laboratory experiences. The study of Computer Science 
                                is the combination of computation and solving information-based problems in the world by the application of theoretical and 
                                practical techniques. The Computer and Information Science program is deddicated to briding the gap between academic pursuits
                                 and technical competencies required in the business environment. The program provides a wide range of courses to lay 
                                 the foundation for further studies and graduate work.</p>
